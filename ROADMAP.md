# MFP Roadmap

Post-v1 enhancements. These are intentionally NOT built in the initial release.

## Planned Enhancements

1. **GraphQL support** — Beyond Swagger/REST; parse GraphQL schemas into callable functions
2. **Multi-container orchestration** — Run multiple code steps in parallel containers
3. **WebSocket streaming** — Stream long-running execution results to the LLM in real-time
4. **Function composition DSL** — Visual function chaining editor for complex workflows
5. **Shared cache** — Redis-backed distributed cache for multi-instance MFP deployments
6. **OAuth2 flow support** — Interactive authentication for APIs requiring user consent
7. **Plugin system** — Custom pre/post processors for API request/response transformation
8. **Telemetry dashboard** — Execution metrics, cache hit rates, most popular functions
9. **Rate limiting** — Per-tool call rate limiting configurable in FastMCP3
10. **gRPC support** — Beyond HTTP REST APIs
